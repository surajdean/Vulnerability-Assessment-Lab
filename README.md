# Vulnerability Assessment Lab

In this guide, I'll be guiding you through setting up a Windows Virtual Machine and using Nessus, a powerful vulnerability scanner. This hands-on project will enhance your expertise in virtual machine management and effective vulnerability scanning.

## Tools Used

- VirtualBox
- Nessus

## Environments Used

- <b>Windows 10 VM</b>

## Part 1: Setup Lab Resources

### Step 1: Download and set up the Virtual Box hypervisor

Before we download VirtualBox, it is important that you first go to the BIOS/UEFI of your computer and enable hardware virtualization support so the hypervisor works correctly. Use [this article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1) for guidance.

Download Oracle's VirtualBox for your respective OS and the VirtualBox Extension Pack from [this website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

### Step 4: Prepare your Windows 10 VM environment for Nessus

To prepare our VM for scanning using Nessus, we need to make it more vulnerable so Nessus can accurately identify any vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

*Go to Settings and then click on Update & Security*

![Update & Security](https://i.imgur.com/TFxgVqM.png)

*Click Pause updates for 7 days (this can be further extended in the advanced options depending on how long you intend to work on this lab)*

![Pause updates for 7 days](https://i.imgur.com/zfsENeW.png)

*Click View update history*

*Click Uninstall updates and go through each update to try to install them if possible (not all of them can be uninstalled)*

![Uninstall updates](https://i.imgur.com/NBM51Ou.png)

*Search Windows Defender Firewall and go to Advanced settings*

![Advanced settings](https://i.imgur.com/ppxtMLw.png)

*Click Windows Defender Firewall Properties*

*Change the firewall state to Off for the Domain, Private, and Public Profile then click Apply then Okay*

The Windows 10 VM should be properly configured to be more vulnerable now. Now we have to make sure the virtual machine is on the same network as the host machine that will perform the scan.

*Within the VM menu, click on Devices, Network, then Network Settings*

*Within the drop-down menu for Attached to, select the option Host-Only Adapter*

![Host-Only Adapter](https://i.imgur.com/kLp3DP8.png)

*Open Command Prompt as an administrator on your VM and type the command ipconfig (this will show you your VM's IPv4 address)*

![Open Command Prompt](https://i.imgur.com/j5rDr7A.png)

*Now on your host computer, open Command Prompt and ping the VM's IPv4 address*

*If the ping is successful, you are good to go. If not, go back and see if you missed any changes.*

### Step 5: Install Nessus
Now we are going to download and install Nessus, a powerful vulnerability scanner.

*Register for an activation code here*

*Once you're registered, click the blue button that says Download*

*Choose the version of Nessus you want to download based on the platform you are running on your PC, and click Download and confirm the license agreement*

![Choose the version of Nessus you want to download]()

*Locate the Nessus installation file you have just downloaded and open the executable*

*Go through the installation wizard process and confirm the installation*

*After the initial installation, a new page in your private browser will open on localhost or port 8834 where you will finish the installation process.*

![]()

*On that new page, click on the button Connect via SSL*

![]()

*If you get a warning about potential security risk, just select Advanced and then click Accept the Risk and Continue*

*You won't be changing any settings or registering offline, So select Continue*

*From the deployment options, choose Register for Nessus Essentials*

![]()

*Skip the registration process, copy the activation code you got in your email, and past the activation code*

*Create your credentials for Nessus and finish the installation process*

### Step 6: Configure Nessus for scanning

*Once Nessus is opened, go to the My Scans section and click Create a new scan*

Here you will different scanning options to assess and improve security
- Basic Network Scan (understand overall security posture)
- Malware Scan (help identify malware)
- WannaCry Ransomware (find indicators of WannaCry)
- etc.

*Choose Basic Network Scan*

![]()

We just need to fill in 2 fields here:
- the name of your scan (this can be whatever you want)
- the IP address or subnet range you want to target (aka the IPv4 address of your Windows VM in this case)

![]()
  
*Click Save*

## Part 2: Conducting Nessus Scans on Your VM

### Step 1: Nessus Initial Scan

Now we will run an initial scan of our Windows 10 VM using Nessus. 
Make sure your have the VM running within VirtualBox before you start your scan for it to work.

Within the My Scans section, click the Launch arrow for the scan you just created for the scan to start
Click on the name of your scan to see the scan in real-time 

![]()

- On the right hand side, you can see a visualizations of the vulnerabilities detected

![]()

To get more detail information, click on the blue bar under vulnerabilities

The vulnerabilities are grouped into different sections based on the technology being used and relevance.

![]()

### Step 2: Nessus Credential Scan Setup

Now we are going to add a credential to our scan to get even more detailed information.

*Go to my scans and click on your saved scan*

![]()

*Go to the top right corner, click on the button Configure*

![]()

*Click on the Credentials section*

*Because your VM is using Windows 10, choose Windows from the 2 categories*

*For the Authentication method, select Password from the drop-down menu*

*Fill in the Username, Password, and Domain you used during your VM's creation process*

![]()

However, if you try to run the scan, you will receive a notification that the account used doesn't have the necessary privileges. To fix that, do the following:

*Go back to the Windows VM and search for Services*

![]()

*Find the Remote Registry and double-click on it*

*Change the startup type to Automatic*

![]()

*Then search and select User Account Control*

*Slide the bar to the bottom to Never Notify and click on OK (this will make it so user account control prompts don't interrupt your scan)*

![]()

*Search Registry Editor and open it as an administrator*

*Click on the following registry in this order: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, SOFTWARE, Microsoft, Windows, CurrentVersion, Policies, System*

*Within the System folder, right-click in the blank space on the right side of the screen, hover over New, and select Default 32-bit value from the drop-down menu*

![]()

*Name the new registry value you just created: LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy*
**(make sure you spell it exactly as shown for everything to work!)**

*Double-click on the DWord value you just created and named to edit its properties and change the Value data field from 0 to 1, then click Okay to save changes*

![]()

*Restart your VM*

This process will allow Nessus to use credential scanning to perform a more comprehensive security scan of your system.

### Step 3: Running a Credentialed Scan

We will now run a credentialed scan on Nessus to see if we can find more serious vulnerabilities in our VM.

*Within the My Scans section, click the Launch arrow for the scan you just created for the scan to start*

*Click on the name of your scan to see the scan in real time*

*Wait a bit for the scan to complete*

Compared to our previous scan, you can see that Nessus has identified more vulnerabilities, some being Critical, High, and Medium, vulnerabilities.

You can learn more about the vulnerabilities you find by searching a specific vulnerability's CVE number on Google and reading up about it.

### Step 4: Downloading Vulnerable Software onto our VM

Now we will add some vulnerable software to our VM and analyze how it changes the results of our Nessus scan.

*In our VM settings, select Devices, Network, and then Network Settings*

*Within the drop-down menu for Attached to, select the option Bridged Adapter (this will give us the internet connectivity we are currently missing)*

Now you can download and install some outdated software from the internet. Here are some options you can download:
- Old version of Chrome
- Old version of 7zip
- ADDDDD LINKS FOR THESE

Now we have a bunch of old, vulnerable software on a VM that we scan and analyze similarly using Nessus as our previous scans

**Before you go back to Nessus to conduct your scan, remember to change your network adapter setting back to Host-Only Adapter**

## Part 3: How to Generate a Report

Creating a report will allow you to share any particular issues found with a specific application with the development team so it can be resolved.

All you have to do is click the Report button at the top right of the page. 

You can configure the options for your report template and generate the report, which will create PDF file which you can share.
